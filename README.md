## ⚡ Core Value Proposition

An accomplished **Lead AI DevSecOps Architect** specializing in securing and automating high-stakes **Cloud** and **Web3** infrastructure. I bridge advanced **AI**, **DevSecOps**, and deep **Cryptography** to build robust, scalable, and compliant enterprise solutions.

### 💀 Offensive & Defensive Mandate
I architect cryptographic systems so secure, even I can't break them (but I keep trying).

| Offense (Breaking) | Defense (Building) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Smart contracts, HSMs, "military-grade" encryption. | Zero-trust systems, MPC wallets, **ZK-rollups**, **dHSM**, and **Entropy-as-a-Service (EaaS)**. |
