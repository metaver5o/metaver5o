## ⚡ Executive Summary

Accomplished **Lead AI DevSecOps Architect** specializing in the intersection of high-stakes Cloud infrastructure and Web3 ecosystems. I engineer autonomous, self-healing security pipelines and zero-trust cryptographic frameworks for enterprise-scale deployments.

* **Core Focus:** Automating the "Unbreakable" through AI-enhanced DevSecOps.
* **Philosophy:** Security is not a gate; it’s a foundation. I architect systems that treat security as code, ensuring compliance and resilience are baked into the kernel of every deployment.
