  WARNING:   I break things for a living. Your "unhackable" system is my

## 💀 **What I Do**  
```
$> sudo make me-a-sandwich
```
I architect cryptographic systems so secure, even *I* can't break them (but I keep trying).  
Specializing in:  
- **Breaking* → Smart contracts, HSMs, "military-grade" encryption  
- **Building* → Zero-trust systems, MPC wallets, ZK-rollups  
- **Burning* → Insecure RNGs, deprecated curves, and your CEO's "blockchain idea"
